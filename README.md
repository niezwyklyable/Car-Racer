# Car-Racer-AI
Another 2D game in pygame module but this time with Q learning algorithm implementation (reinforcement learning). Idea is taken from TechWithTim. This project is the first in which I used inheritence, git and automated tests (pytest). Commentary included as well.

Requirements: pygame, numpy, pytest

To run the game write in cmd: python main.py
